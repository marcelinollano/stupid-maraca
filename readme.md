## FAQ

**Q: Who made this?**  
**A:** It was [@denegro](https://twitter.com/denegro)'s original idea and he also did the cute graphics. [@ferblape](https://twitter.com/ferblape) and [@marcelinollano](https://twitter.com/marcelinollano) implemented the thing, mostly copying from Stack Overflow. [@kekoponte](https://twitter.com/kekoponte) and [@coquedesigns](https://twitter.com/coquedesigns) did the testing and emotional support.

**Q: My maraca does not sound, why?**  
**A:** You must add it to your home screen (see step 2 in the `Setup` section). Mobile browsers limit the access to features of the device. The HTML5 Audio API only works if the webapp is installed on the home screen, or so it seems.

**Q: It this great product free?**  
**A:** Yep, but we may add some in-app purchases to unlock more maracas.
